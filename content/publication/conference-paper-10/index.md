abstract: "The rapid advancement in autonomous technologies high-
lights the growing importance of accurate pedestrian trajectory predic-
tion. While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a potent tool
for this task, their latent spaces often lack controllability. Addressing
this gap, this work presents an innovative method that combines a Graph
Attention Network (GAT) with InfoGAN, enhancing the predictability
and management of GANs’ latent spaces for controllable outcomes. We
adopt graph-based spatial representations of pedestrian movement pat-
terns over time, facilitating the generation of realistic future trajecto-
ries. This novel integration of GAT with InfoGAN is key to our model’s
ability to learn distinct representations of pedestrian behaviors, thus
markedly improving its predictive precision. Evaluation against bench-
mark datasets demonstrates its effectiveness in advancing pedestrian tra-
jectory prediction compared to current state-of-the-art approaches. This
research lays the groundwork for developing more accurate models for
pedestrian prediction, with promising applications in autonomous vehicle
navigation and intelligent surveillance systems. Future exploration could
broaden the scope of this methodology to diverse trajectory prediction
scenarios, concentrating on further enhancing its efficacy and versatility."
