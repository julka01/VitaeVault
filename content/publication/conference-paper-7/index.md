abstract: "Forecasting renewable energy sources is of critical importance to several practical appli-
cations in the energy field. However, due to the inherent volatile nature of these energy sources,
doing so remains challenging. Numerous time-series methods have been explored in literature,
which consider only one specific type of renewables (e.g., solar or wind), and are suited to small-
scale (micro-level) deployments. In this paper, the different types of renewable energy sources are
reflected, which are distributed at a national level (macro-level). To generate accurate predictions, a
methodology is proposed, which consists of two main phases. In the first phase, the most relevant
variables having impact on the generation of the renewables are identified using correlation analysis.
The second phase consists of (1) estimating model parameters, (2) optimising and reducing the
number of generated models, and (3) selecting the best model for the method under study. To this
end, the three most-relevant time-series auto-regression based methods of SARIMAX, SARIMA,
and ARIMAX are considered. After deriving the best model for each method, then a comparison
is carried out between them by taking into account different months of the year. The evaluation
results illustrate that our forecasts have mean absolute error rates between 6.76 and 11.57%, while
considering both inter- and intra-day scenarios. The best models are implemented in an open-source
REN4Kast software platform."
