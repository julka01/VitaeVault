#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me
Hello! I‚Äôm Sahib Julka, a seeker in pursuit of knowledge. As a child, I often wondered about questions like  "If I cut my brain and put it into another body, will it still be me?" This style of inquistion led to a lifelong quest to understand themes like consciousness and intelligence. For me, the true hallmark of having understood a thing is to be able to break it into its simplest form and simulate it in artificial systems.

Today, I'm working towards completing my doctorate under the guidance of Prof. Michael Granitzer at the Chair of Data Science in Passau. My work herein entails accelerating Machine Learning in low-resource domains like Planetary Science and Medicine. I have been involved in developing  pipelines that maximise ML outcomes with limited supervised training data, while enhancing the process to be more causal, controllable, and explainable.

Outside of my research, I am deeply interested in philosophy, music, and human anatomy. In my free time, you can find me playing the guitar, gardening, cycling, and lifting weights ‚Äî all of which keep me engaged holistically.
